1. Build connect with mongoDB, create a cluser from atlas if necessary, connect to it from 
mongodb compass, and create .env file, install dotenv in development mode, ex : yarn add -D dotenv.
    - Steps to connect to mongoDB :
        * Use an ODM (object data model) like mongoose, the alternative is a mongoDB driver.
        * Use mongoose.connect(uri) (async method) where uri is the connection link to mongoDB database, Use try-catch and throw 
        the errors if any.
        * Then manage mongoose events to manage connections like mongoose.connection.on("connected", 
        () => {console.log("mongoose connection successful!")})

2. Create a script for running with and without compiling ts code
    - Steps to create :
        * Go to package.json, create a json object called "scripts" : { "dev" : "npx ts-node src/index.ts", "build" : "tsc -w"}
        * Note that "dist" folder is where the compiled ts code will be generated, i.e in tsConfig we have to change outDir : "./dist"
3. Define the types to be used
4. Create the mongoDB schema and model.
5. Define the routes and their purpose, using express
6. Start writing the controllers for those routes using express
